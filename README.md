# QR Code Service

This is a simple Flask app that allows users to generate and decode QR codes.

## Installation

To run this app, you'll need to have Flask, qrcode, pyzbar, and Pillow installed. You can install these libraries using pip by running the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

Run the app using the command `python qrservice.py`. The app should now be running and accessible at http://localhost:7080.

### Create a Service in Linux

Hereâ€™s how you can create a service file to run the Flask app as a service on Ubuntu Linux or Raspbian:

Copy the `qrservice.service` file into the `/etc/systemd/system` directory. Be sure to update the `User` and `WorkingDirectory` values in the `qrservice.service` file to match your system.

Reload the systemd manager configuration by running the following command:

`sudo systemctl daemon-reload`

Start the QR Code Service by running the following command:

`sudo systemctl start qrservice`

To automatically start the service at boot, run the following command:

`sudo systemctl enable qrservice`

After completing these steps, the Flask app should be running as a service on your Linux system and should automatically start at boot.
